The first output shows the displacement and velocity of the 5s time period.
The 2nd output with 0s time period ended with an error message.

Displacement = 1.7320508075688772
Encountered an error: Cannot be zero or negative time

After switching the 5s with 0s, the program ended early with only showing
the displacement and an error message. The program caught an error because the
denominator for the calculation of velocity was set to 0.
